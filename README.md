# Basic Installer for Arch

This is the installer I help to build in my book, [Building Your Mouseless Development Environment](https://themouseless.dev).

I use this installer to test every month if the content of the book still work.

If you wonder why every month, there's a new version of the Arch Linux live system released every month.

The official installer is part of the mouseless book companion: https://github.com/Phantas0s/mouseless-book-companion
